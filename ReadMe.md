## <a id="how-to-build-and-flash"></a>🛠️ How to Build and Flash

### 1. Build from Source
To compile the firmware for the OLED hardware target, use the Flipper Build Tool:
```bash
# Build the target DFU package
./fbt
```

### 2. Configure & Flash OTP (One-Time Programmable) Memory
> [!CAUTION]
> OTP memory can only be written **ONCE**. It cannot be erased or changed. Proceed at your own risk.

1. Open **`generate_otp_gui.exe`** (found in the [`mics/FlipperOTP/`](mics/FlipperOTP/) folder). No installation required.
2. Set your **Device Name** (max 8 ASCII characters) and **Board Version** (`12` for WeAct STM32WB55).
3. Select **Display Type: MGG** (Monochrome Glass Grid) — required for the SSD1306 OLED screen.
4. Put the MCU into **DFU mode**: hold `BOOT0`, connect USB, release `BOOT0`. The app status will show **🟢 Connected**.
5. Click **"2. Flash (DFU)"** — the tool writes OTP directly to `0x1FFF7000`.

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, click **"1. Save .bin"** to generate the file, then flash it manually via [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html).

### 3. Flash Firmware

Choose the appropriate method depending on whether you are setting up the board for the first time or just updating the firmware.

---

#### Method A: First-Time Setup (or after a Full Flash Erase)
*Use this method if the board is blank, has no bootloader, or was fully erased.*

1. Put the board in DFU mode (hold `BOOT0`, connect USB, release `BOOT0`).
2. Open the **qFlipper** desktop application.
3. qFlipper will detect the board and display **"RECOVERY MODE"** (or **"Update & Recovery Mode DFU started"**).
4. Click the **"REPAIR"** button. qFlipper will automatically restore the official bootloader and partition the internal Flash.
5. Once the recovery is complete, the screen might remain blank (since the official firmware lacks OLED drivers), but the device will now connect to qFlipper.
6. Now, put the board back into **DFU mode** again (so it doesn't freeze under the official firmware).
7. Click **"Install from file"** in qFlipper.
8. Choose your preferred update style:
   * **Using the `.tgz` package (Recommended):** Select the **`.tgz`** archive. qFlipper will flash the firmware (the OLED screen will turn on), reboot into normal mode, and then copy the required resource files to your SD card automatically.
   * **Using the `.dfu` file (Manual):** Select the **`.dfu`** firmware file to flash it (OLED turns on). After it boots, you will need to manually unzip the resources package and copy the files to the root of your microSD card.

---

#### Method B: Regular Firmware Updates
*Use this method to update an already working DIY Flipper.*

* **Using the `.tgz` package:** Connect the Flipper to your PC via USB, open **qFlipper**, click **"Install from file"**, and select the updated **`.tgz`** archive. qFlipper will automatically flash the MCU and update all SD card files in one go.
* **Using the `.dfu` file:** Put the board in **DFU mode**, open qFlipper, click **"Install from file"**, and select the updated **`.dfu`** firmware file.

---

#### Option C: Flashing via STM32CubeProgrammer / ST-Link (Advanced)
> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT use "Full Chip Erase"** in STM32CubeProgrammer!
> Doing a full chip erase will wipe out the emulation OTP structures, flash partition tables, and calibration settings. If these are wiped, the firmware will freeze early during boot (leading to a blank screen and USB connection loss).
> 
> *   Set the Erase option to **"Sector Erase"** (only erase sectors occupied by the firmware).
> *   If you did a full chip erase by mistake, follow **Method A (First-Time Setup)** to rebuild the device partitions first.
